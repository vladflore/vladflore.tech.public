<p>Building a portfolio is a great way to showcase your work and interests, and it can be a good enough motivator to keep you going once you start. It&rsquo;s a great way to show your skills and experience to potential employers or clients, and it can help you stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>That being said, building a portfolio can be a daunting task, especially if you&rsquo;re just starting out.</p>
<p>I am putting this page together to showcase some of my side projects, not necessarily to impress anyone, but to keep track of my progress and to have a place where I can look back and see how far I&rsquo;ve come. All this takes time and effort and has to happen outside of my regular job, that&rsquo;s why the projects listed here are rather small and simple.</p>
<p>All of the projects have originated from a need I had at some point. Rather than looking for a ready-made solution, I decided to build it myself. This way I could learn something new and have a solution that fits my needs and imagination.</p>
<h2 id="portfolio-projects">Portfolio projects</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, the projects listed here are rather small and simple. I decided to build them so that I can learn something new and solve a problem I had at some point. We, as software engineers, love building up and trying new things, and when you can pair that up with a need you want to solve, it can lead to a fun and rewarding experience.</p>
<h3 id="git-animated">Git animated</h3>
<p>This is a series of posts and videos that I put together to help me visualize what happens under the hood when you run a git command. The interesting part, I would say, was animating what happens in the case of some of the commands. The animation was done using <a href="https://www.manim.community/" target="_blank">Manim</a>, a Python library for creating mathematical animations. The posts and videos can be found <a href="http://vladflore.tech/posts/2021/08/git-animated-1/" target="_blank">here</a>. It&rsquo;s a four part series, and I will be adding more as the need arises. The GitHub repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/vladflore/git-animated" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-aired-yet">Is it aired yet?</h3>

    <img src="/images/isitairedyet.jpeg"  class="left"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>As I enjoy, sometims too much, watching TV series, I wanted to have a simple web-based interface to check when the next episode is going to air. I stubbornly refused to use any of the existing solutions, so I decided to build my own. The project was built using <a href="https://pyscript.net/" target="_blank">PyScript</a>, an open source platform for Python in the browser. The data is fetched from the <a href="https://www.thetvdb.com/" target="_blank">TVDB</a> API, and rendered in a rather simplistic table. The project can be found <a href="https://vladflore.github.io/isitairedyet/" target="_blank">here</a>. The GitHub repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/vladflore/isitairedyet" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note: the API requires a token, which is valid for a month, so depending when you access the page, the token might have expired. As I am writing this, the token is valid until 2024-10-08.</p>
<h3 id="workouts-tracker">Workouts tracker</h3>
<p>I mentioned in a previous post that I had started working out more consistently. I wanted a way to keep track of the exercises I am doing and the weights I am using. I could have used a simple spreadsheet, but where&rsquo;s the fun in that? So I decided to build a simple web-based interface, using PyScript, that plots all the exercises I have done and the weights I have used. Additionally, I can see for each exercise the progression of the weights I have used. The project can be found <a href="https://vladflore.github.io/my-workouts-tracker/" target="_blank">here</a>, and the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/vladflore/my-workouts-tracker" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
