<p>Hi Internet,</p>
<p>this is Vlad writing and I welcome you to my corner of Internet where I share stuff about <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, <strong>Computer Science</strong>, and life in general.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that big on talking about myself, so I&rsquo;m just gonna keep it short and to the point.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who are you, Vlad?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Just a man on this planet, currently living in Spain and working as a Software Engineer.
I love learning new things and challenging myself with new things, especially when it comes to Software Engineering and Computer Science. I also like travelling and exploring new places. Check my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlad-flore-a709723b/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile should you want to learn more about the professional Vlad. Feel free to also have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/vladflore" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile should you be interested into my commits.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Why a blog?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I always wanted to have one, but I never had the time, or the inspiration, to put one together and keep it up to date.
Because I do not give up that easily, I said to myself it was time to give it (yet) another chance.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What will you be blogging about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Mainly about <strong>Software Engineering</strong> / <strong>Computer Science</strong> and should the muses be on my side about life and co.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Q: How can people get in touch with you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The best way is over <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlad-flore-a709723b/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/vlad_flore" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. You could also drop me an email at <code>flore.vlad@gmail.com</code>.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
