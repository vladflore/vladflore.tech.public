      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;if you were thinking about screaming little humans, I am afraid I will disappoint you and it might be that this post is not for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are still reading, then you might be one of those people, who thought of something else what could have happened in a period of nine months. I salute you and encourage you to read on!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2020 was a special year, for the world and for me as well, on one side we had that &lt;em&gt;end of the world kind of global infestation&lt;/em&gt; thing, on the other side I managed to make some changes, which hopefully will pay-off in the near future, dare saying some of them have already payed-off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
