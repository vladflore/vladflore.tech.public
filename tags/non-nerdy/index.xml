      <description>TL;DR&#xA;&amp;hellip;if you were thinking about screaming little humans, I am afraid I will disappoint you and it might be that this post is not for you.&#xA;If you are still reading, then you might be one of those people, who thought of something else what could have happened in a period of nine months. I salute you and encourage you to read on!&#xA;2020 was a special year, for the world and for me as well, on one side we had that end of the world kind of global infestation thing, on the other side I managed to make some changes, which hopefully will pay-off in the near future, dare saying some of them have already payed-off.</description>

      <description>Hello Internet,&#xA;so this is my first blog post, which I hope will be one of many more to come. This is more of a hello world kind of post, a way to cut my teeth into blogging and see if it&amp;rsquo;s something I would like doing.&#xA;Should you wonder by now why hello world, well just ask someone who works in IT and has learned at least one programming language.</description>
